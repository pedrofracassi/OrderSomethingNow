## OrderSomethingNow
**OrderSomethingNow** is a free and open source multiplatform JavaFX cashier application. The application's core idea is originated from fast food chains' cashier and ordering systems. As of right now this is a home project for me, dedicated to have fun and learn new approaches in app development.

## How to run
Currently the application is developed with JDK™ Version 9.0.4 (build 9.0.4+11), and run with JRE™ Version 9.0.4 (build 9.0.4+11).
The application will work on with this version of Java, I am not sure about older or more recent releases.
Check [releases](https://github.com/Lireoy/OrderSomethingNow/releases) for the latest version of the program.


(*Note: Application does not work with JDK™ 11.*)
